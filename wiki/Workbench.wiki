#A tool to handle large tables

The *Inserm* *Workbench* is a tool developped at the Center for Polymorphism Studies (CEPH) to help people at handling large tables in a rich graphical environment.

The tool is currently available as a Java webstart application at http://anybody.cephb.fr/perso/lindenb/tinytools/workbench.php

== Requirements ==

  * java 1.6
  * java web start

== Sources ==

the JAVA Sources are available on code.google.com at http://code.google.com/p/cephlib

== Implementation==

*Workbench* use the Java berkeleyDB API ( http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/je/index.html ) to create an index of each row in a table.
The table are temporary (they are discarded when the program exits) but can be made persistent and stored in user's home.

== Manual ==

On opening, the application will create a folder in `${HOME}/.inserm-workbench-db`. The folder will contain the data handled by the Java berkeleyDB API
A first internal frame appear and containing the current persistent datases (The table is empty at the first time the application is launched)


=== Opening a Table ===
  * *from a local file*: menu "File" -> 'load Table' -> 'Load Table'. A Dialog 'Select' appears. Select the file you want to upload into the workbench. Adjust the delimiter (this is a regular expression). Tabulation is the default. Click 'OK'. The file is uploaded  as a temporary table into the workbench. GZipped files are OK.
  * *from a URL*: : menu "File" -> 'load Table' -> 'Load URL'. A Dialog 'Select' appears. Select the URL you want to upload into the workbench (e.g. http://ftp.hapmap.org/genotypes/latest/rs_strand/non-redundant/genotypes_chr1_CEU_r24_nr.b36.txt.gz ). Adjust the delimiter (this is a regular expression). Tabulation is the default. Click 'OK'. The file is uploaded  as a temporary table into the workbench.GZipped files are OK.
  * *from a Database* (at this time only localhost and UCSC are supported):  menu "File" -> 'load Table' -> 'Load SQL'. A Dialog 'Select' appears. Select the JDBC parameters and enter a mysql query in the top left pane. e.g:
{{{
select * from hg18.snp129
}}}
Click on 'test' to see the result and then on 'OK'. The result is uploaded  as a temporary table into the workbench.
